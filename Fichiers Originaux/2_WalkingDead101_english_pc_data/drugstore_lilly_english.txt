96)  LEE
[pickup1] It seems not.
86)  LILLY
[pickup1] But stopping that fight was damn impressive. I couldn't have done it.

[pickup1] We just have to keep our eyes out better -- that radio could've gotten us all killed.
89)  LILLY
[pickup1] I know my dad was... out of line, before but--

[pickup1] Yeah, I saw where that was goin'.
98)  LEE
[pickup1] Sure, but I should've been paying attention to the girl.
99)  LEE
[pickup1] What makes you say that?
100)  LILLY

[pickup1] {thinkingA}You didn't have to call me {angryB}a bitch in front of my people.
111)  LILLY
[pickup1] {angryC}I don't need that shit, all right? It's {sadA}hard enough to be in charge of people's lives {angryB}without some dick cutting you down.
114)  LILLY
[pickup1] {sadB}Now his heart's acting up again, and {fearA}I'm powerless to do anything.
115)  LILLY
[pickup1] {angryB}{body-a}And that violence before; with my dad -- that didn't help.
116)  LILLY
[pickup1] {sadB}[quiet] Sure... I guess.
117)  LILLY
[pickup1] {fearA}{body-a}And...[quiet] You should {sadA}know I didn't think he was in the right.
