{SadA} My dad doesn't know how bad it is.
24)  LEE
{sadA} No, he doesn't.
25)  SHAWN
{FearA} I saw a guy in Atlanta kill a kid. A boy. Just shot him right in the face.
26)  
Silence
27)  
Sometimes it's kill or be killed.
28)  LEE
{fearA} Damn.
29)  LEE
{thinkingA} You gotta do what you can to survive.
30)  LEE
{disgustA} Was the boy one of the walkers?
31)  
Damn.
32)  
You gotta do what you gotta do.
47)  LEE
You gotta do what you gotta do.
33)  
Was the boy one of the walkers?
34)  SHAWN
{SadA} No shit, damn.
35)  SHAWN
{fearA} Like put a gun to that kid's head and pull the trigger? {disgustA} Fuck that, man.
36)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} I don't even know. He was either attacking the guy or asking for help.
37)  SHAWN
{angryA} You don't see things like that. {normalB} It's not like in the movies.
38)  SHAWN
{FearA} He didn't even hesitate. He just turned, put the barrel of the gun right between this kid's eyes {sadB}and pulled the trigger.
39)  LEE
{normalD} Oh, uh...
40)  SHAWN
{sadA} Did you have to do it?
41)  LEE
{thinkingA} Do what?
42)  SHAWN
{thinkingB} Yeah. It's not like a rag doll or a puppet without strings. It's heavy.
43)  LEE
{normalC} They don't fall like you think.
44)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} Kill. Have you had to off one yet?
45)  LEE
{thinkingA} I had to shoot one.
46)  LEE
{disgustB} I bashed a poor girl's brains in.
48)  LEE
{normalD} Sometimes it's kill {angryA}or be killed.
49)  
I had to shoot one.
50)  
I bashed a poor girl's brains in.
52)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} It's cool, don't worry about it.
106)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} It's cool, don't worry about it.
53)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} I could shoot one, maybe. {sadA} If it were far away.
54)  SHAWN
{fearB} Whoa, I couldn't do that.
55)  SHAWN
{sadA} I guess. {thinkingA} I don't think I'd sleep good after that.
56)  SHAWN
{normalC} How about yours? How's your family?
91)  SHAWN
{normalC} How about yours? How's your family?
57)  SHAWN
{happyA} I'm just glad we're getting this fence built. {sadA} Dad just wants to keep the family safe and thinks inviting people in is a bigger threat than {thinkingA}whatever's out there.
58)  LEE
{normalC} My brother and parents are in Macon, {sadA}I hope.
59)  LEE
{thinkingA} I'm not quite sure where my ex-wife is.

66)  SHAWN
[awkard ex-wife talk] {happyB} Ah. {thinkingB} Oh. {sadA} Yeah. For sure.
67)  SHAWN
{thinkingA} Oh. Well, they weren't in Atlanta, right? {sadB} So that's good.
68)  SHAWN

107)  SHAWN
