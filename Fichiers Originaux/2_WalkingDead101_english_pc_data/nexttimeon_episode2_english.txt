That's bullshit. You've saved his life -- hell, all our lives -- plenty of times in the last few months.

Things can, uh, get tense back at camp. Lily and Kenny sure got different ways of doing things. It wouldn't have been that way back on Robins.
91)  MARK
I mean -- when you found Clementine, why'd you take on that responsibility?
92)  MARK
So why did you do it, Lee?

That was different.  Duck wasn't bitten. But, come on,  we KNOW this guy's not gonna make it.
107)  LEE
Kenny, listen-
109)  LEE
The wall's looking good, Doug.
110)  DOUG
Thanks. I also worked up a little "early warning system" for outside.
111)  LEE
Early warning system?
112)  DOUG
Well... it's just string with some cans attached, buy hey, it works.
113)  LEE
Thanks for keeping the kids over here.
114)  CARLEY
Yeah, well, my instinct was to run over and get the story.  But ... yeah... the kids didn't need to see that.
115)  CARLEY
Oh, and do me a favor and talk to Lilly about getting some rest.  You and I are supposed to be on watch together tonight.  I need you sharp.
116)  KENNY
[furious] You said he wasn't bitten!
117)  BEN
It's not the bite that does it! Yeah, the bite will kill you, but...
118)  BEN
You come back no matter how you die.  If you don't destroy the brain, that's just what happens.  That's what's gonna to happen to ALL of us.
126)  LEE
These folks are just delaying the inevitable.

This place is going to fall apart, just like everywhere else.
