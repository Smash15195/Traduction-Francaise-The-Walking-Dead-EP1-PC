{normalC} A man asks you your name, you give it. {disgustA} Unless that name is no good.
2)  HERSHEL
{angryA} You should know that if you weren't leaving with Kenny today, {disgustA} I wouldn't stand for your lack of honesty last night.
3)  LEE
{thinkingB} I'm not sure I follow.
4)  HERSHEL
{disgustA} How'd you get out of Atlanta?
5)  LEE
{sadA} ...On foot. I headed south and {fearA}hoofed it out of there. [sets logic liar]
6)  LEE
{normalD} ...I got a ride and then I was in a wreck. I walked until your boy found me.
7)  LEE
{normalD} ...I was on my way out anyway. Timing of all this just happened to be right. [sets logic liar]
8)  
On foot.
9)  
I got a ride.
10)  
I was on my way out anyway.
11)  
I was on my way out anyway.

13)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} That's a long walk.
14)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Hmm. Well you're no worse for wear.
15)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Ha, if there ever is a good time for the supposed "apocalypse."
16)  HERSHEL
[incredulous] {thinkingA} Well, I'm sure it was complicated.
70)  HERSHEL
[incredulous] {thinkingA} Well, I'm sure it was complicated.
17)  LEE
{thinkingA} Was brought up to, yes.
18)  LEE
[trying to change the subject] {fearA}{body-C} This {happyB}farm's a nice plot of land.
19)  HERSHEL
{sadA} Never was the plan, having a place like this. It was in the family, and I guess so was I. {happyA} Family's important; it's all that matters. {thinkingA}You agree with that?
20)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Where's your family now? Parents? Wife? Girlfriend?
21)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Heh, had you told me twenty years ago I'd be still be doing this,{happyA} I would told you that you were full of crap.
22)  LEE
{normalD} My parents are in Macon, with my brother.
23)  LEE
{normalD} No wife, not anymore. I think she's up in Virginia, maybe.
24)  LEE
{normalD} No family. {happyA}I had a beta fish on my desk at the University.
25)  LEE
...
26)  
My parents are in Macon.
27)  
No wife anymore.
28)  
No family.
30)  HERSHEL
{happyA} Well I hope they're all right.
31)  HERSHEL
{sadA} Sorry to hear it.
32)  HERSHEL
{sadA} I hope someone remembered to feed him.
33)  HERSHEL
{angryA} Fine. Keep your mouth shut. {disgustA} Rude as hell, but what's a man to do.
71)  HERSHEL
{angryA} Fine. Keep your mouth shut. {disgustA} Rude as hell, but what's a man to do.
34)  HERSHEL
{sadA}{body-D} But now you've got this little girl to take care of.{body-handships} Clementine, is it? {thinkingA}You just stumbled up-on her?
36)  LEE
{normalC}{body-A} Yeah, I was looking for help in her house.
37)  LEE
{normalC}{body-A} I was being attacked and she came to my rescue.
38)  LEE
{thinkingA}{body-A} What are you getting at?
39)  
I was looking for help in her house.
40)  
I was being attacked and she came to my rescue.
41)  
What are you getting at?
42)  HERSHEL
[judgmental, distrusting] {disgustA} Hmmph. [like, is that so]
43)  HERSHEL
{angryA} Can I give you a piece of advice?
44)  LEE
{normalB} Sure.
45)  LEE
{angryA}{body-C} What is it.
46)  LEE
{angryB}{body-C} Mind your own business.
47)  
Sure.
48)  
What is it?
49)  
Mind your own business.
51)  HERSHEL
{normalC}{body-D} I don't know who you are or what you did.
52)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA}{body-D} But you better become a better liar, and fast.
53)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} But you better figure out your story. Or at least what you want your story to be.
54)  HERSHEL
{fearA} Let's say things don't get better back in the cities. {normalB} Or they get worse before they do. {thinkingA} You're going to have to depend on the honesty of strangers if you're going to make it. {sadA} And if those same people get to questioning yours, you're going to be in trouble.
67)  HERSHEL

55)  HERSHEL
{disgustA} So whoever you are, and whatever you did, keep it to your damn self.
68)  HERSHEL
{disgustA} So whoever you are, and whatever you did, keep it to your damn self.
56)  HERSHEL
[a hmmph, kind of to yourself] {happyA} But at least you have the common sense to listen to a man giving you advice.
57)  HERSHEL
{fearA} Oh, and {angryA}I'd start checking the attitude, friend.
58)  HERSHEL
{sadA} Oh, and {angryA}trying to be less of an asshole would serve you just fine.
59)  HERSHEL
{angryA} And another thing: {thinkingA} you're going to have to figure out how to answer a goddamn question when someone asks.
60)  HERSHEL
{surprisedA} GO! I'll get my gun.
61)  SHAWN
[super far away scream] SHIT THEY'RE HERE! [gets leg trapped] AHH! HELP!
62)  CLEMENTINE
[SCREAM!] AHHHHHH!
63)  LEE
{fearC} What the?!--
64)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] And honestly, I don't even want to know.
65)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] {disgustA} I ain't dumb. I caught you in that lie last night; about who were with in that car.
66)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] HMMPH. [pissed]
72)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] HMMPH. [pissed]
