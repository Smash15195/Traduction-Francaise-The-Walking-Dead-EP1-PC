838)  LARRY
[pickup1][argument] Do you? You're not fucking acting like it!
839)  LILLY
[pickup1][argument] Dad, we get it, it's a big deal.

845)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][across the room]There's someone in there.
846)  KENNY
[pickup1][argument] No, you're just the guy arguing for killing a kid!
847)  LARRY
[pickup1][argument] Hey, I'm not the bad guy here, I'm just looking out for my daughter!
848)  LARRY
[pickup1][argument] He's covered in muck! She'll find the bite. WATCH.
849)  KATJAA
[pickup1][argument] [from across the room]No! I'm cleaning him up! There's no bite! He's fine!
850)  LARRY
[pickup1][argument] And if she DOES?
851)  KENNY
[pickup1][argument] She won't.
852)  LEE
[pickup1] But it looks it like she's losing control of her people.
853)  KATJAA
[pickup1] KENNY! STOP HIM!
854)  LARRY
[pickup1] He's covered in their blood! You'll find the bite. [cont,]
855)  LARRY
[pickup1] We gotta throw him out! Or smash his head in!
856)  KENNY
[pickup1] [seething]Shut up.
857)  LARRY
[pickup1] Don't you fucking people get it? We've already SEEN this happen. We let someone with a bite stay and-and WE all end up bitten!
858)  
He's just a boy.
859)  
Deal with it.
860)  
We do what you say.
861)  LEE
[pickup1] He's a little boy; I think we can handle him.
862)  LARRY
[pickup1] A little boy?! He'll be an uncontrollable man eater!
863)  KENNY
[pickup1] It's not gonna happen!
868)  KENNY
[pickup1] It's not gonna happen!
864)  LARRY
[pickup1] It is and we're tossing him out NOW!!!
867)  LARRY
[pickup1] It is and we're tossing him out NOW!!!
865)  LEE
[pickup1] Then we deal with it then. But right now we're just freaking everybody out.
866)  LARRY
[pickup1] Then get ready to deal with it because that boy is BITTEN.
869)  LEE
[pickup1]Then we do what you say. We toss him out and save the group.
870)  KENNY
[pickup1] Lee?! What the fuck man?
871)  LEE
[pickup1] What other choice is there?
872)  LARRY
[pickup1] FINALLY. Someone gets some sense. But we can't wait - we are tossing him out NOW!!!
873)  LARRY
[pickup1] The first thing he'll do is sink his teeth into his mom's face.
874)  LARRY
[pickup1]Then once she's dead, he'll probably pounce on YOUR little girl.
875)  LARRY
[pickup1] She'll turn fast and then they'll be three.
876)  LARRY
[pickup1] And that, boy, is the ballgame.
877)  LARRY
[pickup1] Which pretty much seals the deal for me. We're throwin' him out!
878)  
Hit him, Kenny. [Stop him]
879)  
NO! [Stop him.]
880)  
You're right. [Let him.]
881)

[pickup1][hyper aggressive] NO. You don't touch that boy, you don't TOUCH anybody.
885)  LEE
[pickup1] [hyper aggressive] I've got a little girl I'm trying to protect in here too. You want to get violent you old fuck?! Well, COME ON. You better have a plan to kill me though, because it's ME before anyone else in here.
886)  LEE
