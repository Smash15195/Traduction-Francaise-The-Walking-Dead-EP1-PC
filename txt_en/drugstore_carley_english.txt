{SadA}{body-C}Yeah.
21)  LEE
{SadB}{body-C}I'm sorry.
22)  CARLEY
{SadA}My news editor was eaten about five feet away from me, and {FearA}I would've joined her if it wasn't for that {SadA}dorky guy on watch over there.
23)  
You handle yourself well.
24)  
That guy saved you?
25)  LEE
{DisgustB}{body-C}That guy saved you?

29)  CARLEY
{HappyB}{body-B}Yeah, can you believe it? {FearA}Those creeps, or-or ghouls or {AngryB}whatever the hell they are, they were pulling our van apart and that guy, {FearA}Doug, {HappyA}just came to the rescue.

{FearA}Huh? {HappyA}Oh...nothing.
31)  CARLEY
{ThinkingB}Right.
32)  CARLEY

[pickup1] Couldn't figure it out, huh?
77)  LEE
[pickup3] Yeah, give it a try.
78)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Eh, I'll keep trying.

[pickup3] You don't have to be... it's traumatic.
102)  CARLEY
[pickup1] I'm sure some people got out. Maybe they're all being rescued. Then again, maybe not.
103)  LEE
[pickup3] You're really "fine"? All of your colleagues are probably dead.
104)  CARLEY
[pickup1] You don't think I know that?!? Of course I'm not fucking fine! God, Lee. Just, leave me alone.
105)  LEE
[pickup3] Alright, then. We don't need to talk about it.
