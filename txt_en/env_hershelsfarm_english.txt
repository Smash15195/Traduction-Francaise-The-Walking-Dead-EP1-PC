27)  HERSHEL
[Rhetorical] {happyA} Tough guy, huh?

[Lie] {thinkingA} I fell trying to get away from one of those things.
51)  LEE
[short] {sadA} Car accident.
52)  LEE
{sadA} I just twisted it.
53)  LEE
{thinkingA} I don't even remember. {sadA} It's crazy back there in the city.

63)  LEE
{sadA} I found her on own just outside of Atlanta.
64)  LEE
{happyA} Thanks. She's {thinkingA} not my daughter.
65)  HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Oh?
66)  SHAWN
{sadA} {body-standB} Hey dad, {thinkingB} so I'm thinking, first thing tomorrow, we gotta reinforce the fence around the farm.
67)  HERSHEL
[pickup1]House is full up with mine. We've got another displaced family of three sleeping in the barn. You and your daughter are welcome to rest there, when we're done here.
68)  LEE
{normalB} I'm looking after her until we {normalC}find her parents.
69)  HERSHEL
{disgustA} That doesn't seem necessary.
70)  SHAWN
[pickup1] I don't know what you saw on TV, or heard on the radio, but there's some {fearA}serious...[keeps it down with a kid around] {thinkingA} SHIT hitting the fan.
71)  
Your son is right.
72)  
I wouldn't worry too much.
73)  LEE
{normalA} Your son's right. {angryA} You're going to want to fortify this place.
74)  LEE
{thinkingA} I wouldn't worry too much.  We're pretty far from the city, it seems like that's where it's the worst.
75)  SHAWN
{angryA} Dad, I'm serious. {sadA} Lee, come on, tell him what you saw out there, man.
76)  HERSHEL
{happyA} Stuff like that doesn't happen around here, Shawn.
77)  LEE
{fearA} I watched a man let himself get run over without blinking an eye.
78)  LEE
{fearA} I saw a cop come back from the dead.
79)  LEE
{fearA} I got chased by two undead monsters. Zombies, {thinkingA} as dumb as it sounds.
80)  LEE
{fearA} Teenage girl with her guts spilled out on the floor stood up from the dead and tried to bite me.
81)  
I watched a man let himself get run over.

88)  LEE
[giving in] {normalD} All right.
89)  HERSHEL
{happyA} Well, I'm all done here. It should start to feel better tomorrow.
90)  LEE
{normalA} All right then.
91)  LEE
{happyA} Thanks.
92)  HERSHEL
{normalB} There's blankets and such in the barn. We'll be seeing you bright and early.
93)  HERSHEL
{happyB} Goodnight, Clementine.
94)  HERSHEL
{angryA} I already said ok.
95)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB} Goodnight.
96)  HERSHEL
{sadA} Well, do what you think you should.  {normalA} We've got plenty of chores as it is.
97)  SHAWN
{normalA} Lee and those folks in the barn can help out in the morning. {thinkingA} We gotta do it, really.
98)  CLEMENTINE
[mumbled sleep talk] {fearB} They're-they're out there... eating... I don't want to go...
99)  LEE
[kind of to himself] {normalA} The barn is safer {thinkingA} but not any comfier.
100)  LEE
{happyA} I know what it smells like.
101)  LEE
[quiet] {sadA} Shh. You're dreaming.
102)  CLEMENTINE
[dreaming, asleep, mumbled] Sorry, dad.
103)  CLEMENTINE
{normalA} I'm glad I'm not in the treehouse toni...
104)  CLEMENTINE

127)  KENNY
{happyB} That's my boy, Ken Junior. We call him Duck, though.
128)  LEE
{thinkingB} Duck?
129)  LEE
{happyA} Dodging or quacking?
130)  LEE
{thinkingB} Where do parents name their kids Duck?
131)  
Duck?
132)  
Dodging or quacking?
133)  
Where do parents name their kid "duck"?
134)  LEE
{normalC} That's a valuable trait lately.
135)  KENNY
{normalB} Yea. Nothing bothers him. {happyA} Like water off a duck's back, y'know.
136)  KENNY
{thinkingA} No kidding. {sadA} But frankly, I think it's because he's dumb as a bag of hammers.
137)  KENNY
{happyC} But he makes up for it with enthusiasm.
138)  DUCK

{happyB}{body-standA}  I want to build a fence.
170)  LEE
{happyA} Ok, I'd appreciate that.
171)  LEE

If you see anything, get inside.

536)  HERSHEL
{sadB} You don't need to say anything. {angryA}You tried.
252)  HERSHEL
{disgustA} If your girl is ever trapped you better hope you get stronger or your {angryA}friends aren't cowards.
253)  HERSHEL
{angryC} The hell I can't. You watch your back. {disgustA}Wait until it's your daughter and you need his help.
254)  HERSHEL

371)  SHAWN
[pickup1] Oh, not his daughter, he was her neighbor.
372)  SHAWN

[awkward] Ok, that'd be preferable.
415)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] We'll clean it, re-dress it and you'll be fine.
416)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] If your leg gets hot or the swelling doesn't go down; you're probably dealing with an infection.
417)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] We'll probably just have to shoot you.
418)  LEE
[pickup1] What do we do then?
419)  HERSHEL
[pickup1] Where were you headed? Before the car accident?
420)  HERSHEL
