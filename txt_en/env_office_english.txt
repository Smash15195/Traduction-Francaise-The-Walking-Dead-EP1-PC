1)  LEE
{happyA}	This was my dad's cane. He'd zip around here on it from time to time.
2)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}	Was he sick?
3)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}What's that?
4)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	My dad gave it to me.
5)  LEE
{happyC}See, Dad's are smart like that.
6)  LEE
{happyC}Plus he knew how to make it look cool. Like you, with your hat.
7)  LEE
{happyB}Nah, he was ok. I actually saw him whoop shoplifters with it. This cane's protected this place better than any guard dog ever could.
8)  LEE
[to himself] {sadA}I can't... {thinkingA}I can't think about them in here.
9)  LEE
[to himself]{thinkingA} My parents came in here hoping to survive...{fearA} but it looks like one of them was hurt. I wonder if it was my dad. Trying to be a hero, maybe. {sadA}Or protect her, at least.
10)  LEE
{normalB}	Luckily there's nothing I need in here.
11)  LEE
{happyC}There's a band-aid in there, I bet.
12)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	Oh, good.
13)  LEE
{normalB}A First Aid Kit.
14)  LEE
{happyB}Want to head back into the drugstore with me?
15)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	Ok.
16)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}	Lee?
17)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}You're not bad, right?
18)  LEE
[like, 'yeah, what is it?'] Yeah?
19)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}	That lady said you killed someone.{sadA} Was that because he was one of the things trying to eat you?
20)  LEE
{surpriseA}I...{normalD}why are you asking me that?
21)  
No, he wasn't.
22)  
It's complicated.
23)  
Yeah, he was.
24)  LEE
{normalD}	No. He wasn't. [the guy you killed wasn't a zombie]
25)  LEE
{normalC}	It's complicated. Sometimes things happen or... {normalD}you do things and you can't explain them.
26)  LEE
{normalD}Yeah, he was.
27)  LEE
[was he a bad guy?] {angryB}He was.
28)  CLEMENTINE
[distrusting] {fearB}Was he bad?
29)  CLEMENTINE
[small, timid]{sadA} Oh.
30)  LEE
{happyA} Let's uh... head back to the others.
36)  LEE
{happyA} Let's uh... head back to the others.
303)  LEE
{happyA} Let's uh... head back to the others.
31)  LEE
{happyA}That's right.
32)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}	And you had to protect yourself?
33)  CLEMENTINE
Oh, ok.
35)  CLEMENTINE
[doesn't get an answer - distrusting] {sadA}Well{thinkingA}...nevermind. It's nothing.
302)  CLEMENTINE
[doesn't get an answer - distrusting] {sadA}Well{thinkingA}...nevermind. It's nothing.
37)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Lee?
38)  LEE
{normalB}	Yeah?
39)  CLEMENTINE
{fearA}What if my parents come home and I'm not there?
40)  LEE
{surpriseA}They'll uhh... track us down. {thinkingA}Don't worry.
41)  LEE
{thinkingA}I don't think they will.
42)  
They'll find us.
43)  
I don't think they will.
44)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Yeah. Ok. {thinkingA}We should keep a look out.
45)  LEE
{happyA}They want you to be safe. {happyB}We'll find them if we can.
46)  CLEMENTINE
I've got my walkie-talkie in case they try that way.
47)  CLEMENTINE
[waiting for an answer]{ normalB}Lee?
48)  CLEMENTINE
[waiting for an answer] {angryA}I asked you a question...
49)  LEE
{thinkingA}	I ought to clear a path to opening that door.
50)  LEE
{normalC}	We better stay at it.
51)  LEE
[referring to his dad] {thinkingA}I wonder how many nights he spent at this desk. {sadA}Thousands.
52)  CLEMENTINE
[a little grunt, pushing a heavy thing]{fearA}Ugh!
53)  LEE
{happyA}	Here we go.{normalB} Watch your fingers in the drawers.
54)  LEE
{happyA}Sure.
55)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	Can I help?
56)  LEE
[to Clementine]{happyA} Better get this door clear, huh?
57)  
How are you doing?
58)  LEE
How are you doing?
59)  
How are you doing?
60)  
Things have been scary, huh?
61)  LEE
{normalD}Things have been scary, huh?
62)  
You don't need anything, right?
63)  LEE
{thinkingA}You don't need anything, right?
64)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}It's not good.
65)  LEE
{thinkingA}	No, it's not.
66)  CLEMENTINE
But I think it'll be ok.
67)  CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Yeah. It's not that heavy.
68)  LEE
How about with everything outside.
69)  LEE
{sadA}	Neither do I, Clementine. {thinkingA}Nobody does, I don't think.
70)  CLEMENTINE
Yeah...
71)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I bet my dad does.
72)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}It's not good. {fearA}I don't know why everyone is crazy.
73)  LEE
{thinkingB}But you're cool?{happyA}
74)  LEE
{happyA}	Ok, good to know. And you don't have any allergies or anything I should know about, right?{thinkingA} Don't kids have allergies or asthma or just general maladies?
75)  CLEMENTINE
I think so.
76)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}My friend Alfred has a peanut allergy.
77)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}	No. {sadA}I get hungry a lot.
78)  CLEMENTINE
[pushing a heavy thing] Ugh!
79)  CLEMENTINE
[out of breath for]
80)  LEE
{happyA}	All right, a little further.
81)  
Because they're dead.
82)  
I hope not. It's just complicated.
83)  CLEMENTINE
[out of breath for a second]{thinkingA} Do you have kids?
84)  CLEMENTINE
[pushing a heavy thing] {angryB}Ugh...grrr...ugh.
85)  LEE
{thinkingA}Ok, here we go.
86)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}You don't have a family?
87)  LEE
{normalB}	No.
88)  
Lets just move this thing.
89)  
...What do your parents do?
90)  
Let's not talk about that. Do you play sports?
300)  LEE
Let's not talk about that. Do you play sports?
91)  CLEMENTINE
{normalA}Like… um... social studies?
92)  LEE
{happyA}	Those are good jobs.
93)  LEE
{happyA}Yeah, like that.
94)  CLEMENTINE
{normalD}	My mom is a doctor and my dad is an engineer.
95)  CLEMENTINE
{normalB}What's your job?
96)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}	You didn't answer my question...
97)  LEE
[changing the subject] {happyB}What do your parents do?
98)  LEE
{thinkingA}	I, uh, teach history {happyA}and writing and things like that.
99)  CLEMENTINE
{normalA}	Do you like sports?
100)  CLEMENTINE
{normalD}	Why don't you want to talk about your family?
101)  CLEMENTINE
What's that?
102)  CLEMENTINE
[digesting] Oh. {happyB}Neat!
103)  LEE
{happyB}	I like football and I play squash with a buddy of mine.
104)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I play soccer, but I don't really like it.
105)  LEE
It's like indoor tennis without a net.
106)  LEE
{happyA}	I'm not crazy about it either.
107)  CLEMENTINE
[Short]{normalA}Oh. Ok. I'm sorry.
108)  LEE
{normalD}	Lets just move this thing.
109)  LEE
{happyA}	It's fine.
110)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}Why don't you want to talk about your family? {sadA}Do they like... hate you?
111)  
I wouldn't blame them.
112)  CLEMENTINE
I'm just sorry for being mean.
113)  LEE
{sadB}	Because they're dead.
114)  LEE
{happyA}	You didn't know.
115)  CLEMENTINE
[gasp]{fearA} Oh. I'm sorry.
116)  CLEMENTINE
Why?
117)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}But you love them, right?
118)  LEE
{thinkingA}	I hope not. It's just complicated, that's all.
119)  LEE
{angryB}	It just is.
120)  LEE
{happyA}	Yeah, of course.
121)  LEE
{normalD}We didn't fight. {sadB}We just didn't talk for a while.
122)  LEE
{thinkingA}	I wouldn't blame them.
123)  CLEMENTINE
{fearB}	Why? Did you fight?{sadB} I fight with my mom sometimes.
124)  LEE
{thinkingA}I got into some trouble and then I didn't talk to them for a while.{sadA} This used to be their store.{happyA}  But let's just keep that between you and me, ok?
125)  CLEMENTINE
{sadA}	Yeah.
126)  LEE
That's right. [a beat] Now let's get this done.
127)  LEE
{angryA}Look,{sadA} my family is gone and {angryB}I just wish things would've been different.

{angryA}You're Lee Everett. You're a professor at Athens who killed a State Senator who was sleeping with your wife. [a beat, explaining how she knows this] This is your parent's store; folks around town know the owner's son got himself a life sentence, but I'm a reporter for WABE in Atlanta.
150)  CARLEY
I paid attention to that trial. Maybe you're a murderer. But I don't really care. Frankly, that's a skill that might come in handy.
151)  LEE
{thinkingA}	Hmmph. [disregarding]
226)  LEE
{thinkingA}	Hmmph. [disregarding]
152)  CARLEY

You seem like an ok guy, and the last thing we need is drama out there. You've got this little girl to take care of, and... [her eyes drift to Clementine, she's thinking about what would happen if Lee was in fact a bad guy] look, don't make me wrong on this.
156)  LEE
{angryA}I don't plan to.
229)  LEE
{angryA}I don't plan to.
157)  CARLEY
Good. Because if this lasts longer than a few days and you're a detriment to the group, then we'd have a problem.
227)  CARLEY
Good. Because if this lasts longer than a few days and you're a detriment to the group, then we'd have a problem.

{normalB}You can't, {thinkingB}I suppose. {happyC}But you don't have many other options
238)  CARLEY
{normalB}You can't, {thinkingB}I suppose. {happyC}But you don't have many other options
169)  CARLEY
{thinkingA}Well, you better try.

Locked and barricaded
173)  
Barricaded, have not learned that it's locked
174)  LEE
{thinkingA}That's the door to the pharmacy, we should be able to find pills for Larry in there.
176)  LEE
{thinkingA}We ought to clear this door for when we find the keys.
178)  LEE
{thinkingA}	It's locked, we need to track down the keys if we're going to help Larry.
