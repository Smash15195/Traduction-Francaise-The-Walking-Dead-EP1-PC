[pickup1] I know the feeling, man.
69)  
Do you know the combination to the lock outside?
70)  GLENN
[pickup1]You're probably better off breaking it if you have to.
71)  LEE
[pickup1] Oh you know, I thought I'd go stretch my legs.
72)  LEE
[pickup1] Do you know the combination for the lock on the gate outside?

[pickup2] Why the hell would you do that?
78)  LEE
[pickup3] I know I did.
79)  GLENN
[pickup2] You let her do it, you know. You said give her the gun.
80)  GLENN
[pickup2] Why didn't you tell Carley to just give it to her?
81)  LEE
[pickup3] [sad, agreeing]Seems like.
82)  GLENN
[pickup2] I guess she really wanted that gun...

[Remain Silent]
84)  
[Remain Silent]
85)  
She was dead anyway.

Mercy.
87)  
She didn't want to live.
88)  LEE
[pickup3] She was dead anyway, all bitten up like that. It was over for her.

[pickup3] I think it was over for her, Glenn.
93)  GLENN
[pickup1] You never know; you can't give up hope.
94)  GLENN
[pickup2] I...I guess.
95)  LEE
[pickup3] She didn't WANT to live. She would've found a way to end it.
96)  LEE
[pickup3] You can't make someone fight. We gave her the least painful option.
97)  GLENN
[pickup2] You can't even explain it yourself. Well you should know I wouldn't have done it.
113)  GLENN
[pickup2] You can't even explain it yourself. Well you should know I wouldn't have done it.

[pickup2] I'm with you. [i agree]
106)  LEE
[pickup3] I'm glad to hear it. [earnest]
107)  LEE
[pickup3] It would've been a waste of a bullet.
108)  LEE
[pickup3] She's gone now anyway.
109)  GLENN
[pickup2] Whoa, man. She was a person.
110)  LEE
[pickup3] She was dead anyway. I'm not in the euthanasia business.
111)  GLENN
[pickup2] [confused] What do you mean?
112)  GLENN
[pickup2] [response to silence from player]Well... I'm glad you didn't. Really.
