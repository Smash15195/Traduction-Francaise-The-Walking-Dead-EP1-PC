872)  LARRY
[pickup1] ENFIN. Quelqu'un qui a du bon sens. Mais on ne peut pas attendre - on va le foutre dehors MAINTENANT
873)  LARRY
[pickup1] La première chose qu'il va faire, c'est enfoncer ses dents dans le visage de sa mère.
874)  LARRY
[pickup1] Puis, une fois qu'elle sera morte, il bondira probablement sur votre petite fille.
875)  LARRY
[pickup1] Elle se transformera vite et alors ils seront trois.
